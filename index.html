title: Managing Chaos

This is where I will catalog my journies down the many different Rabbit Holes I find my career takes me down. I use the term 'Rabbit Hole' since it really seems to apply well to the challenge of 'Managing Chaos' as I am expected to do every day.

Call me a System Administrator, Network Administrator, DevOps, Technologist or any other current buzz word that may be floating around out there I don't see a need for any of them. I work with technology and as such pigeon holing me into one classification or another just doesn't work.
