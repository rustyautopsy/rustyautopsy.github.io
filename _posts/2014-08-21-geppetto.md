Our dev build env wants to share out Puppet assets via Samba. I have used this however to get it to work you need to symlink a bunch of stuff around, and I don't have the patience for that.

So I have used [RSE](http://www.eclipse.org/tm/) before, and it has failed, and also been victorius.

Anyway...
