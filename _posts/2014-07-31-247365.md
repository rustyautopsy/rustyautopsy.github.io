As the title of this post reads, I have been available for 24x7x365 my entire carreer. Some would say "that sucks" others
may say "run for the hills" or "shouldn't that have gone away with senority". Well it is what it is.

Sure I have mitagated many items over the  years, removed every single point of failure, added high availabilty, etc etc.
However I don't see a time where this job won't require being on call in some way, it comes with the teritority.
