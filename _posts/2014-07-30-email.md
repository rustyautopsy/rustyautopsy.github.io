When dealing with public facing email systems all sorts of fun happens. The need to protect from brute force attackers, malformed messages, virus, spam, o how wonderful email really is.
I am very confident in handling high volume, high IO, highly available email systems. Through out my journeys I have also had to work with hosted providers like Exchange 365, Google Apps, and that exchange server your CEOs nephew set up in his basement.

Since email is used for a wide array of marketing purposes now a days, the need to monitor IP reputation is more and more important. Using techniques like multiple IPs for outgoing messages, adhering to ESP best practises, real time blacklists, unsubscribe and list management helps to ensure increased email deliverability. In my opinion having a solid understanding is these types of techniques is integral to the mail admin of today.

Experienced in integrating third party providers for mass email/campaigns.
