I have been working directly with clients from day one. When you start in a small shop you tend to wear many hats. 
Over time my direct interaction with clients has lessened, however I still get directly involved when complex technical 
issues need to be addressed.

I have the ability to take a stressfull situation and "walk the client off the ledge". Usually what works best is listening
and taking ownership. Implementing imediate action (when possible) makes a world of difference and can almost always turn a 
difficult situation into a mutally productive relationship.

I can remember as a child I was fired from a local burger joint because I was "not a people person" I can confidentally
say that has been addressed.
